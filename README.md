## Data Availability  
The datasets used for this study include sensitive patient information extracted from the electronic health record. They are therefore subject to federal legislation that limits our ability to make them publicly available, even after being subjected to deidentification techniques. To request access to the de-identified minimal datasets underlying the findings illustrated in our paper, interested and qualified researchers should contact Information Technologies & Services Department of Weill Cornell Medicine support@med.cornell.edu.
